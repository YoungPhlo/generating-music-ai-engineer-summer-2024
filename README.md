# AI Music Generation: From Prompt to Production
### Goal: For the workshop to be interactive, for it to be fun, and for you to walk away with something tangible.
- Scaling sounds: is AI Music commercially viable?
  - How do we define AI Music?
    - Compartments
      - Style Transfer: Audio Filter, Voice conversion

    - Misnomer
      - is it really AI Music if AI is a tool the human is using to create?
      - maybe AI Assisted Music is more accurate
        - akin to Photographers reaction to Photoshop
        - or musicians and drum machines

        - TOS points
          - Very broad license to your inputs and outputs
          - Allows for Midjourney style display of outputs
          - You can only use the song commercially if you are a paid subscriber
    - Defending your IP
      - Works created solely by AI are not eligible for copyright protection
      - Human authorship is a fundamental requirement for copyright
        - If the "traditional elements of authorship" (like melody, harmony, rhythm in music) are determined by AI without human creative direction, the work is not copyrightable.
        - Simply providing a prompt to an AI system is not enough to establish human authorship.
        - The human must have creative control over the output, not just influence over the general topic or style.
      - What qualifies as sufficient human input?
        - A human creatively selecting and arranging AI-generated musical segments could be eligible for copyright protection.
        - A human significantly modifying AI-generated music to add original expression could make the modified work copyrightable.
      - Best case scenario: You go viral. Anyone going viral using your idea gives you credit.

  - Perspective
    - I think the current use case of Udio and Suno as meme song generators is a lot of fun but
      - Producers want more control. Will create at a greater pace given more tools.
      - Side note: [compulsory mechanical license for music covers](https://www.romanolaw.com/youre-covered-when-to-obtain-a-compulsory-mechanical-license/)
    - This will make music production more accessible. Will be seen as tools just like a DAW or a plugin. Many integrations to look forward to.
    - The human connection in music triumphs.
    - The US Copyright Office's stance right now is AI gen cannot be copyrighted. This has not been held up in the Supreme Court yet. We'll see how it plays out in the future.
  - Where we are headed
    - an AI assisted DAW
