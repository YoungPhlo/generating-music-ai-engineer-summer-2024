1
00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:03,933
I'm excited to be here.

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:11,602
I really have one main goal in mind, and that's for this talk to be, or this workshop to be interactive.

3
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:15,426
I want it to be fun, and I want you guys to walk away with something tangible.

4
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:20,111
So I, we can actually switch to the slides.

5
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,007
So it should be live now.

6
00:00:25,307 --> 00:00:33,431
If you guys want to go ahead and go to this link that I have up on the screen or use your phone to go to the QR code, I have some notes for you guys with that URL.

7
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,952
But those are my statement goals for this workshop.

8
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:44,615
I want to really probably start by asking you guys some questions so I can get some interaction flowing.

9
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:45,836
But I'm glad you guys came.

10
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:46,997
Thank you for coming.

11
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,797
I really appreciate it.

12
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:52,239
The music stuff is something I have been

13
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:55,924
into for a long time, like lifelong musician, artist.

14
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:00,187
But the AI music stuff is something I just started paying attention to.

15
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:05,369
With regards to the tools I'm going to show you today, maybe about a month or so ago.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:17,296
So basically what this workshop is going to be about is I'm going to start with the insights that I've gained by like doing all the research over the last 30 days, and then we'll get straight into the tools so you guys can, again, walk away with something tangible.

17
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:19,717
Let's start with...

18
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:25,073
Okay, by, I know it's early, and I'm still vlogging myself.

19
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:34,579
So, you know, you don't have to necessarily go crazy here, but by show of hands, how many of you have ever used a music generation model, period?

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,261
Okay, nice, about half you guys.

21
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,102
That's dope.

22
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:47,486
By show of hands, how many of you guys use, I had someone in the crowd already say that they use Boomy.

23
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,867
Have you guys ever used Boomy before?

24
00:01:49,460 --> 00:02:03,236
Okay, that's your OG if you use Boomy, because it was from like two years ago, but it was a music generation model that was actually pretty cool, but didn't get as complex as the music generation models that we have today.

25
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:08,162
How many of you guys have ever used Suno or Udio by showing hands?

26
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:09,842
Okay, nice.

27
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,063
Okay, so you guys will be familiar with what I'm gonna do today.

28
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:20,947
Hopefully I can show you guys some advanced prompting techniques at the least, but for the most part, those are the tools that we're gonna be focused on.

29
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:25,829
I was doing this earlier, asking some of the AV crew what you guys' favorite artists are.

30
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,511
My man right here in the middle, if you could name your favorite artist of all time, what would it be, who would it be?

31
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:33,672
Yes.

32
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:36,853
Miles Davis, okay.

33
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,163
And correct me if I'm wrong, because that's a little bit out of my league.

34
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:43,925
Like, blues, R&B, jazz?

35
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:45,306
OK.

36
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:45,526
OK.

37
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:47,588
I think I have something special for you today.

38
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:51,490
So let's start.

39
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:58,455
I can get into a little bit of what we're going to do as well.

40
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,398
And I actually would like to say, because I've already talked about my workshop goal, what I would actually like to say

41
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,947
I am not a classically trained musician.

42
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,369
I wrote my first song when I was 13.

43
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:16,172
But I welcome any discourse you guys have in terms of accuracy.

44
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:20,354
So if you guys feel like you're actually wrong, that's cool.

45
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:20,974
I welcome that.

46
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:31,680
And I actually have something for you on that link that I showed earlier where you can submit questions or comments live while we're doing this to either correct me or submit a question or whatever.

47
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:34,520
So that was one of the main things I wanted to say.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,827
I try to be as accurate as possible, but if I do something wrong, feel free to call me out.

49
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,329
I'm comfortable with that.

50
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm cool with that.

51
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:45,517
And actually, let me make sure I have my stuff pulled up.

52
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:51,955
If you guys can go to this link, there's a link on there that says poll.

53
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:57,017
If you guys can go fill out that poll, I think there's like two or three questions on there.

54
00:03:57,377 --> 00:04:01,960
If you guys can go to that link now and start submitting your answers, I'd really, really appreciate that.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:10,284
Again, I want this to be really interactive, but I also want to tailor it to specifically what you guys want to know about AI easy generation.

56
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:27,658
Now I've done some housekeeping, I can kind of get into my journey here.

57
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:32,580
I would say I'm way more of a, first of all, my name's Flo as you guys may or may not know.

58
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:36,282
I'm way more of a songwriter than like a software engineer.

59
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,513
But I have a lot of respect for what you guys do.

60
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:46,278
I know enough Python to be dangerous, but beyond that, I'm not really that good at software design or engineering.

61
00:04:46,759 --> 00:05:03,950
But I, over the pandemic, took a lot of time out to learn how to write scripts, and I'm really moving into automation, so I need Python for automation for a lot of my stuff, daily, personal, life stuff, and stuff for work as well.

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,991
The other thing I would say is,

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,742
I'm really, really big into experimentation.

64
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:16,271
Phlo is actually my artist name, and if you go on Google or YouTube or Spotify, Apple Music, you can actually look me up and find my music.

65
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:23,960
But the truth is that I have a very eclectic taste, and I have experimented in a lot of different genres.

66
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:32,250
A couple years ago, I decided that I wanted to do some split testing, which is pretty odd for an artist.

67
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,212
But I did want to do some split testing.

68
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:40,879
And what I really found out was that the same song under two different artists can perform while we debut.

69
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:50,869
So I literally would take the same recording, like I'm a self-taught engineer, would record it at my home or other studios, and upload it under two different artists' names.

70
00:05:51,229 --> 00:06:00,493
And depending on the cover art, the marketing, who you try and target when you're posting online in terms of the daily content, I would see that songs would perform differently.

71
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:05,675
So what I basically did was start creating these quote unquote pin names and putting out music that way.

72
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:10,157
And I actually have a pin name that has way more streams than my actual artist name.

73
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:15,560
So if you look at me as an artist, I don't have many streams, but I have a couple pin names that have been viral.

74
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,781
I have one that's got like five million streams over the last couple months.

75
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:20,502
And it's just instrumental music.

76
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:24,225
So I'm an artist that does R&B and hip-hop, but I experimented with EDM.

77
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:27,967
I actually have a song with some country influence, believe it or not.

78
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:29,569
So I've just been experimenting a lot.

79
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,650
And that's kind of how we got here today.

80
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,254
I like to say I was experimenting with multiple genres way before AI music got here.

81
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:40,537
But I love AI music for that reason.

82
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:45,721
And this workshop will cover AI music generation and demystifying it.

83
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,262
I kind of like distilling better.

84
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,443
But you know, Taji P.T.

85
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,184
gave me this word, so I put it in the slides.

86
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:57,057
And we're going to get hands-on with Suno in the video and talk about turning ideas into song.

87
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:04,240
And then, actually, I have a question about this later on, but I really want to talk about opportunities for using AI music.

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,263
I'm super passionate about distribution and for regular, everyday artists to be able to make an income from their music.

89
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:16,585
So if any of you guys are actually artists, I would love to get into those type of discussions.

90
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:21,370
Let's see.

91
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,472
Have you guys, did anybody actually fill out the email I was asking about?

92
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:28,035
Let's see.

93
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:28,716
I'll just connect it.

94
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:31,939
All right.

95
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:39,445
Because I really can start throwing in little tidbits here and there about what you guys want to learn about.

96
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:50,522
I put like, one of the options that I put for the pool is like an advanced option where we can like actually pull down some of the music that Suno is generating, get stems for that music, and start to like mix and master it.

97
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:54,925
So I don't know if any of you guys would actually be interested in that, but I put that as.

98
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:56,406
Yeah?

99
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:56,927
Okay, awesome.

100
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,914
Yeah, that was the hardest thing about preparing for this.

101
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:04,577
I just don't know exactly who's going to be in the crowd and what level they're at.

102
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:08,881
So I tried to come up with a couple of different tracks just for this presentation alone.

103
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,723
But yeah, I just needed you guys' feedback.

104
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,904
So we did do a bunch of solutions.

105
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:20,871
And it looks like content needs, OK, tweaking, a lot of content needs.

106
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:21,151
OK, cool.

107
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,730
I have this guy that I call the Pomp Master.

108
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,631
If I show up, how many of you guys are in the Suno Udio Discord server?

109
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,132
Oh, you're in there?

110
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:30,372
OK, nice.

111
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:32,613
Even for you, I think I'll have a treat.

112
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:37,975
Because there's a couple of people in there that have posted since the beginning of Suno Udio.

113
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:43,697
And this is one guy who's been able to do some really, really cool banjo music and bagpipe music.

114
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:44,518
That's insane.

115
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,399
But the pomps are very unintuitive, in my opinion.

116
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,620
So you have to see it to understand what it's doing.

117
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,515
So with that being said, I'll make sure that I include a lot of content.

118
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,536
So thank you for everyone that just came in.

119
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:01,279
I appreciate you guys coming in.

120
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:10,226
Right, so this actually gets into, you might notice that it's, you might notice that it's okay.

121
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,870
It did actually work, but I still might play with my computer.

122
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:24,510
This is where we start with the insights that I've learned by studying AI music and how it got to this point over the last couple months.

123
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:34,673
And then I'll get into, it's kind of painful, but I have to play some videos for you guys to catch up to where I'm at in terms of understanding and how this whole thing developed.

124
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:39,634
So we'll have some videos to watch, maybe five or six minutes of videos.

125
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,336
When people say AI music,

126
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,747
I think that can mean a lot of different things.

127
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:59,355
And when I first started doing my research, it was really frustrating that everyone meant something slightly different.

128
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:06,801
So what I've tried to do is compartmentalize the definitions of AI music and tidy up the definitions.

129
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:10,264
Because there was a lot of blurred lines when I started doing the research.

130
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:17,995
And the way that I compartmentalized this was to say that we have text to music.

131
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,704
where you're generating short samples and full songs using text prompts.

132
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:30,168
You have audio to music, and this is where you're taking an existing sound and transforming it into actual music.

133
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:35,132
And you have style transfer, which is basically voice conversion.

134
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:41,877
And voice conversion is actually the first thing that came across when I found AI Music last year, actually.

135
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:45,440
So it's been a long time coming, but I didn't really start doing the research until recently.

136
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,541
But I think what most people call AI music is really actually just voice conversion.

137
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:55,402
It's hard to say that now, but maybe when I started doing research, it was.

138
00:10:55,462 --> 00:11:06,265
But I would say that the general consumer, what they call AI music is mostly just style transfer, where someone puts their voice and converts it to another voice.

139
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:10,806
And that actually leads into the first video, and I'll go ahead and play it now.

140
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,226
You guys may have seen this video.

141
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,007
It's actually pretty cool.

142
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:31,245
You might notice that I sound like Kanye West.

143
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:31,745
No easy.

144
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:34,806
Could we turn it up just a little bit?

145
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:36,607
He gets a little louder later.

146
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:42,269
You might notice that I sound like Kanye West.

147
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,590
No easy to record a voiceover for me for this video.

148
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,910
I didn't learn how to do impressions.

149
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:47,990
This is AI.

150
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,191
So let me come back to my original voice for a second because this is crazy.

151
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:55,033
Today on Metaverse, I posted AI Kanye covering a popular song.

152
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:56,433
Here's an example of him singing.

153
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:05,437
That's clearly crazy, and I started thinking, you know, what are the implications of this for the music industry?

154
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:11,780
Now all you have to do is record reference vocals and replace them with a trained model of any musician you like, which is exactly what I did.

155
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,141
I found this Kanye style beat on YouTube.

156
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:18,003
I wrote eight bars, and I'm gonna record them now, and then I'm gonna have A.I.

157
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:19,583
Kanye replace me.

158
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,965
I got a fantasy that's beautiful, that's dark and twisted.

159
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,846
But I attacked a whole religion all because of my ignorance.

160
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,107
What was I thinking?

161
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,087
That was submission.

162
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,928
I lost Adidas, but I'm still Yeezy.

163
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,828
Back in the kitchen, man, I'm a genius.

164
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,709
Boys in the hood, just like I'm easy.

165
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,010
Kanye Weezy, South Side of Chicago.

166
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,970
Life ain't easy.

167
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,311
All praise be to Lord Jesus.

168
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:41,691
Donna, please rest easy.

169
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:42,832
All right, let me cut it there.

170
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:43,412
Let me cut it there.

171
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:46,313
So let's hear those vocals I just recorded now with Kanye.

172
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:50,575
I got a fantasy that's beautiful, that's dark and twisted.

173
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:54,417
But I attacked the whole religion, all because of my ignorance.

174
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:55,678
What was I thinking?

175
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:56,658
That was some bitching.

176
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,519
I lost some leaders, but I'm still easy.

177
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,400
Back in the kitchen, man, I'm a genius.

178
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,301
Boys in the hood, just like I'm easy.

179
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,583
Kanye Weezy, South Side of Chicago.

180
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:05,543
Life ain't easy.

181
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:07,924
All praise be to Lord Jesus.

182
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:09,145
Donna, please rest easy.

183
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,386
All right, let me cut it there.

184
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:10,986
Let me cut it there.

185
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,067
Yo, that knew you.

186
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:15,789
So you guys kind of get the gist of what he was doing there.

187
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,072
But I think a lot of times when we do AI music, that's what it is.

188
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:30,519
It's like someone taking the regular songwriting process where you go get production or do the production yourself, you write the lyrics and then record your own vocals, and then

189
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:37,302
What people are calling AI music is really just style transfer or voice conversion where they're taking that voice and turning it into someone else's.

190
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:41,764
So this is actually the first shout out to this guy's name, Roberto Nixon, if I'm not mistaken.

191
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:47,787
And I saw this video and it kind of, I think it just definitely changed the trajectory of what I was doing at the time.

192
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:52,189
I dropped everything and was like, I have to figure out how the heck he can do this Kanye West voice thing.

193
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:56,620
So I pretty much followed the steps in this video.

194
00:13:56,881 --> 00:14:01,945
I dove into some Discord servers and some subreddits and that's how I really figured out how to do this for myself.

195
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:10,292
So I think that's one compartment that I've kind of like created for AI music and put it to the side.

196
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:14,295
The other one, well actually I have a couple more examples of this as well.

197
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:20,340
I think the next one is,

198
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,371
How many of you guys with a big bunch of other hands, how many of you guys heard that Drake, A.I.

199
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:25,432
song from the garden last year?

200
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,556
Okay, we got a couple people, nice.

201
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:34,460
So I'll play it, I don't want to play the whole thing, but again, this is another example of voice conversion.

202
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,402
And a lot of people were saying, oh my god, he pressed a button and generated a whole Drake song, and that's not really the truth.

203
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:47,706
This kid, his name is Ghostwriter, the person behind the song, and he did an interview where he talked about the process of creating the song, and it was all him, except for the actual vocals.

204
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:50,227
He changed his voice to sound like Drake in the beginning.

205
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,528
I'll play a little bit of it.

206
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:05,990
Just

207
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:25,585
That's actually my favorite part but I'm gonna cut it off.

208
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:31,567
So the Drake song was interesting to me because I kind of saw an unravel.

209
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:40,289
Like I think I found the video or heard the song and it was like under a thousand views.

210
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:50,112
for being posted in some of those subreddits that I was talking about, but it went super viral.

211
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:53,253
I think he got like 9 million streams in the first 24 hours.

212
00:15:53,634 --> 00:16:00,636
He was on his way, that ghostwriter was on his way to charting, of course, before the RIA got ahold of him and was like, we're shutting this down.

213
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,838
So he got DMCA'd and the song got wiped from everywhere.

214
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,860
You can still find it on the internet, but it pretty much got wiped from everywhere.

215
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,763
And I just thought, man, this is really going to change everything.

216
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:17,627
But again, everybody was calling it and saying it was AI music without being specific about what kind of AI music it was.

217
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:24,172
So I have a couple more videos to show you guys, but I just wanted to go over the Drake one, because I thought that was pretty cool.

218
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:29,735
This next one is actually my favorite example of voice conversion that I've seen to date.

219
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,796
Let me backtrack a little bit.

220
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:38,866
These two songs that I just played, or videos that I just played, are from roughly a year ago, I think March of last year, April of last year.

221
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:49,152
Since then, the voice conversion tools have gotten 10 times better, and when I was listening to the Kanye West one back then, it literally blew my mind, no joke, a lot.

222
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:55,435
And today, I kind of listen to it, and I'm like, oh, it sounds really artifact-y, it's bad, it doesn't exactly sound like a natural human Kanye West.

223
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:59,237
But today, they have stuff that sounds almost exactly like Kanye West.

224
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:07,488
And I say the kids because when I joined the Discord server, it was literally a bunch of like 14, 15, 16 year olds doing these conversions.

225
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:17,394
But the kids have gotten a lot better at like training these models, these voice models.

226
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:21,196
So the next one is actually my favorite example of voice conversion.

227
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:24,638
How many, by a show of hands, how many of you guys in here are familiar with Brandy Travis?

228
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,672
Yeah, I knew I was gonna get y'all back there.

229
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:28,512
Yes, sir.

230
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:29,553
Yes, sir.

231
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:36,597
Okay, so Randy Travis, and forgive me, because I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but he lost his voice some time ago.

232
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:53,486
And Randy Travis and his team kind of saw this AI thing unraveling, or unfolding, and decided to sit down, write a song, produce a song, and then use this voice conversion technique for Randy to sing the song without him actually singing the song.

233
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:54,976
This is one of my favorite examples.

234
00:17:55,296 --> 00:18:07,345
I think also in the last year or so, the, maybe temperament is not the best word, but the general public opinion about A.I.

235
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:08,826
music has shifted a little bit.

236
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:09,867
It hasn't gotten too much better.

237
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,008
It's really taboo, honestly.

238
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:15,351
I was a little bit nervous about doing this conference, because people just do not like A.I.

239
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:16,632
music at all, don't want it in their lives.

240
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:23,237
But since then, this Randy Travis song came out a couple of months ago, or a couple weeks ago, I think it was.

241
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:31,081
And when I looked at the YouTube comments of this video, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.

242
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:33,762
People were in the comments saying, I'm a 75-year-old man.

243
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,423
I'm bawling tears right now listening to this Randy Travis song.

244
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:41,685
They were like, we don't care how you get Randy, as long as you get him back, we'll take AI or not.

245
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,145
You know what I mean?

246
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:49,667
So it just was a really cool example of, I think, how voice conversion can be used in the right way by the original artist.

247
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:50,888
So I'll go ahead and play some of this as well.

248
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:24,156
They had eyes like diamonds, and caught the light Oh, but they were dark and deeper

249
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,129
Hello, hello, okay.

250
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,230
Sorry, I apologize to the Randy Travis fans in the back.

251
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,112
I'm gonna cut him off a little bit.

252
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:41,992
I just wanna keep it going.

253
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:51,740
Even though I'm not super into country music, I thought it was really touching that he was able to get with his team and use AI to create new original music.

254
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,582
I thought that was really cool.

255
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:57,124
So that pretty much takes care of the style transfer stuff.

256
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:58,285
I've showed you guys some examples.

257
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,467
The next thing I wanna get into is text to music.

258
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:05,590
And I'll go over full songs as opposed to

259
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:21,846
The short samples that I was talking about, if you go, I just want to remind you guys, if you go to the link, AITalk.com slash music, and submit a question on there, I can see a pop-up on my screen, so I can answer it in motion.

260
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:26,271
I also want to repeat it out loud for the transcription and all that good stuff.

261
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,832
Okay, so.

262
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,599
Text-to-music, text-to-music, text-to-music.

263
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:33,220
I'm gonna show you guys a couple examples.

264
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:46,306
I broke text-to-music down even a little bit further by having, I have a couple folders here, and I think the way I did text-to-music was, yeah, meme songs and samples.

265
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:51,669
Okay, by show of hands, how many of you guys have heard about this Drake and Kendrick Lamar meme going on?

266
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:09,625
So for anyone who hasn't been paying attention, just know that one man said very disparaging words about another man, and then the internet ran with it.

267
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:10,988
So I don't have to catch you up on.

268
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:14,085
18 million songs that these men have recorded now.

269
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,750
I couldn't even keep up with myself to be honest with you.

270
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:28,620
Basically the internet ran with this whole concept of BBL Jersey and Kendrick Lamar set a lyric in one of these songs that they had back and forth over the last couple of weeks where he called Drake BBL Jersey.

271
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:31,082
I don't want to explain BBL to y'all.

272
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:35,734
So I hope hopefully you understand what a BBL is, and they call it BBL Jersey.

273
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,575
And it's funny because it can be taken a couple different ways.

274
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:40,575
But I'll just play the music.

275
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,255
I'm not rambling too much.

276
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:47,977
BBL Jersey.

277
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:51,218
BBL Jersey.

278
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:17,099
My grandma would probably cut me off if I turned that off early, but I'm gonna cut it there and basically say that

279
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:33,692
This song was, to me, this is really what gets to what AI music is, because there's a comedian named King Bolognese who logged into Udio, one of the tools I'm going to tell you about, typed in a prompt, I think typed in some lyrics, if I'm not mistaken, and generated this song.

280
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:40,453
He didn't get in the studio, he didn't record his vocals, there was no voice conversion, he just typed in some words and got this BBL Jersey song.

281
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:49,418
This is like a monumental moment in music as well because it was one of the first times I saw something like this go viral.

282
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:57,804
And I think, we'll get into, I mean we can if you guys are interested, we can get into some of the legality of AI generated music and the copyrights around it.

283
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:06,955
But I think this moment where he created this BBL Jersey song and went viral, it's been used in a bunch of different songs now.

284
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:08,696
It's like monumental.

285
00:23:08,716 --> 00:23:09,997
But this is text to music.

286
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,698
There was no prior recording.

287
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:16,000
He just generated this song on one shot, a pomp to a song.

288
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:23,685
I think I might have one more good example for, you know, I'm going to play this for a little bit.

289
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:36,894
Eleven Labs is another AI startup that has now entered the text-to-music space, and this is a song that they generated.

290
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:38,576
Again, no prior recordings.

291
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:40,057
This is just text.

292
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:42,839
Music came out the other end, and it went viral on Twitter.

293
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:03,778
Programming young, dreaming that one day we'd make it work.

294
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:13,901
Lines of code we'd write all night, hoping that one day we'd get it right.

295
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:16,702
Can we teach them?

296
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,214
Oh, he was about to get into it.

297
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:20,635
I cut off a little too early.

298
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:25,136
But basically, this is a sort of meta song because it's an AI model singing about GPUs.

299
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:28,577
I thought that was pretty cool.

300
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:33,698
But yeah, another text to music song that I would kind of put into the meme song category.

301
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,759
That being said, I think I had, oh yeah, so audio to music.

302
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,961
These are actually the most interesting samples, examples, and also assurances, if I'm not mistaken.

303
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:50,614
So I'll get into some of these.

304
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:51,354
These are really cool.

305
00:24:51,394 --> 00:25:11,628
I think the people who are like musicians or artists who have a lot of talent already, like musical talent already, are into, let me play this, into this style of music generation because it takes an existing sound and turns it into another song.

306
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:13,590
An existing sound and turns it into music, sorry.

307
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:43,690
This is using stable audio.

308
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,210
It's another tool.

309
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,052
It's not Suno or Udio, but it is called stable audio.

310
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:55,638
And I think this was the first tool I saw that had this feature publicly available where you could put audio in and get a song out or get music out, maybe not a full song.

311
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,583
But I really like this because I think it unlocks a lot of different ways to create music.

312
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:06,466
So I think that's, I might have one more example to show you guys.

313
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:11,124
This one was cool, this is also from the Suno team.

314
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:14,265
Has a post-distable audio.

315
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:15,285
This one.

316
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:15,785
Nice, okay.

317
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:45,126
So I thought that was pretty cool because literally all he recorded was his fingers drumming like that on the desk and then out came this full song with the guitar and all these other instruments.

318
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:52,648
So I think that's, you guys kind of get the gist of like what audio to audio model generation or music generation can be like.

319
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:59,871
And I want to say with that, we can get directly into actually generating some songs ourselves.

320
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:19,040
Okay, we can talk about how it works, but you guys didn't really seem so much interested in the technical side when I was looking at the poll, so I could briefly touch on it, but I think, by a show of hands, how many of you guys saw that Suno and Udeo have been, are getting sued this week?

321
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,361
You guys saw that?

322
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:24,284
Yeah, the RIAA just filed a complaint against both services.

323
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:33,949
So, and what they're alleging is that these AI models are trained on massive music data sets that are copyrighted and we are

324
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:36,752
without weed, don't put me on no indictments.

325
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:45,894
That's another thing I didn't mention at the beginning, but I have no affiliation to Suno, Udio, Sable Audio, Umi, no one.

326
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:53,316
I just like this stuff and learned it and figured it out and wanted to do a presentation on it.

327
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:59,237
But what they're alleging is that Suno and Udio are infringing on their copyrights by training on this music.

328
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:11,381
Yeah, we had a comment from the audience saying that the last generation sounded like Tom Petty.

329
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:21,567
If you are more interested in how these models actually work, the architecture, transformers versus diffusion, I have a link on the page that I mentioned earlier.

330
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:28,551
If you click on the notes button and scroll all the way to the bottom, I've compiled a list of all of the music model papers.

331
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:31,293
So if you guys are interested, you can find it there.

332
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:45,381
Okay, so what I want to do now, as we get into Udio and Suno, there is a lot less people than I thought there was going to be, so this will work well, hopefully.

333
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:53,688
But there's a business card on the table in front of you, and that business card has a secret code on it.

334
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:58,831
It's a little PVP, survival of the fittest, like may the best man win.

335
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:02,174
But if you take that secret code,

336
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:19,744
go to the link that I showed earlier, let me put it on the screen again, and click on the gateway button, there should be a green gateway button that looks like this, and you put in that code, what will pop up is a username and a password.

337
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:27,711
If you use that username and password to sign into any of these services, let me try and make it a little bigger than that,

338
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:35,750
If you want to get into Oudio, you can use Google, Discord, Twitter, Apple.

339
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:36,951
I've signed up for all the services.

340
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:43,073
If you want to get into Suno, you can do Discord, Google, or Hotmail, Microsoft, whatever they're calling it now.

341
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:46,555
And then you can sign in.

342
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:50,176
So what I did for this presentation, so you guys could generate music freely.

343
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:55,538
Because I know in the show notes for this workshop, I put that you guys should have your own account.

344
00:29:55,818 --> 00:30:00,380
But I also thought it would be cool if we could do unlimited generation as opposed to what they give you on the free account.

345
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:06,660
So what I did was I signed up and paid for a Premier account for Oudio and Suno and gave you guys a login just now.

346
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:11,947
So if you go log in, you can generate music as we're talking about the next couple steps.

347
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:39,998
Just know that, I think 2FA is on Apple, if I'm not mistaken, so there might be some difficulty getting in, but just try and get into one of these services, then log into Udio or Suno, and then the URL for that, I think I have it here, is udio.com, once you've signed into one of the other authorization services, or suno.com will get you into one of these sites.

348
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:42,237
Works?

349
00:30:42,418 --> 00:30:42,658
Nice.

350
00:30:42,998 --> 00:30:43,258
Awesome.

351
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:43,919
We got somebody in?

352
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:45,140
Oh, another person.

353
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,041
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

354
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:47,382
Hey, PVP.

355
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:48,583
Some of you guys might not make it.

356
00:30:52,246 --> 00:31:04,716
But yeah, I just wanted to do that so you guys had a... And actually, what I'm going to do as well, when you guys are in your seats generating songs, there's another link on this aietalk.com slash music page where it says submissions.

357
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:07,559
What I want to do, we might be tight on time,

358
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:14,012
But what I want to do is have everyone who generates songs here in person to submit to this link.

359
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:15,752
It's basically just a Google form.

360
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:24,697
So you generate some music, take the share link to that music on either service, click on this link here, submissions, and submit your song.

361
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:35,042
And I think what I'm going to do at the end is just take a random number generator, and two people will be selected to keep access to these two accounts that I set up.

362
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:41,366
So one of you guys will walk away with like a Suno account, one of you guys will walk away with a Leo account.

363
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:42,807
And I decided, I paid for the premiere.

364
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:44,088
I didn't pay for the whole year.

365
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:48,071
After they got sued, I was like, yeah, I might not want to invest.

366
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:51,413
So I just went ahead and did 30 days.

367
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:54,356
OK.

368
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:58,239
So we can get into some of the techniques.

369
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,563
While we're on this topic, and you guys are hopefully generating in your seats as well, does anyone here have a birthday this week?

370
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,911
Nice, my man, crazy Travis.

371
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:10,972
What's your name?

372
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:11,732
Patrick.

373
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:12,653
Patrick.

374
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:16,314
OK, I think what we're going to do is generate a birthday song for Patrick.

375
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:21,516
And I'm going to do that from my account.

376
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:23,417
Immortalize Patrick.

377
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:24,157
One more time?

378
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:25,537
I'll be immortalized.

379
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,698
Yes, absolutely.

380
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:29,119
Patrick, my man.

381
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,941
Randy, Travis.

382
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,942
Oh, they're going to block that fan.

383
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:39,802
And music.

384
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:43,664
I'm not even going to try.

385
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:44,704
Usually, you can just write it.

386
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:47,125
There you go.

387
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,447
Yeah, they just, I don't know.

388
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,288
Udio may not be as bad about this.

389
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:57,730
But if you put artist names, and obviously, now because they're being sued,

390
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:02,445
But if you put artist names, they have a content filter, you know what I mean, they don't.

391
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:08,767
Yeah, but I try to put a payment in, because I'm just adding it, you're giving me some info, and then like Detroit style, it always put it.

392
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:09,588
Absolutely.

393
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:13,849
I'm going to talk about that as well, like ways to kind of get around the filters.

394
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:15,030
But yeah, that definitely works.

395
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:26,975
We had a comment from the audience that basically said, if you change the spelling up a little bit, and then put like the style of music that the artist is related to, you can reduce the scale.

396
00:33:29,028 --> 00:33:29,588
An attorney.

397
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:32,249
He's a patent attorney, so put that in there.

398
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:32,969
Oh, shit.

399
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:34,569
Oh, you're the one suing us.

400
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:39,490
Let's put in some... Patrick, what do you like?

401
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:45,231
What kind of music do you like?

402
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:47,291
Pretty eclectic.

403
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:58,438
Okay, the band.

404
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:00,699
Rockabilly is the band.

405
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:01,960
Which is what genre?

406
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,821
Rockabilly.

407
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:06,661
One more time.

408
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:07,382
Rockabilly.

409
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:08,722
Rockabilly.

410
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:10,843
I'll be honest with you, I'm lost.

411
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:13,464
You said the band?

412
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:14,344
The band.

413
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:15,565
The band, yeah.

414
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:21,447
Let's go ahead and generate a song for my boy Patrick.

415
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:27,167
And then I'm going to take the same prompt.

416
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:30,408
I'm kind of getting into some of the prompting techniques here.

417
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:34,911
But you guys are able to see this screen, I hope, and see what I'm doing.

418
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,634
And then we'll play a song.

419
00:34:41,674 --> 00:34:43,855
Couldn't generate that song description name, Rainy Travis.

420
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:47,017
What about Tandy Ravis?

421
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:51,739
I think like four or eight.

422
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:02,314
Who is Ravis?

423
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,735
Listen, brother, just give me my song.

424
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:04,955
All right.

425
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:18,098
All right, so I'm not monologuing the whole time.

426
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:18,918
I'm going to wrap it up.

427
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:24,680
But the way I think of these two different services is that Oudio is more like a songwriting partner.

428
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:31,444
They have an experimental model that you guys have access to if you log into that premier account that I paid for.

429
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:36,046
But the default audio experience is that you generate 30 seconds of music at a time.

430
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:46,729
And you can either extend that idea, remix that idea, or there's a third option I didn't write here and you can scrap it because a lot of times you get weird stuff when you're not great at prompting.

431
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:58,373
You can also use in-painting to modify specific sections of a song, like if you want to change or tweak one or two little things.

432
00:35:58,954 --> 00:36:06,699
And then now they have this feature within Udio where you can do the audio to audio and it allows you to upload music.

433
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:12,883
So if you are an artist and you write songs or have written a song before or spoken word or anything,

434
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,982
I would urge you to try to take one of your creations, especially if you've recorded it, it gets crazy.

435
00:36:20,723 --> 00:36:31,550
If you've recorded some music before, you should take the tempo, the key that that song is in, and your lyrics, and put it into Udio and see what comes out the other end.

436
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,711
It's blown my mind a couple times.

437
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:37,374
I've taken a couple of my own songs and put them in, and it gets crazy what comes out the other side.

438
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:39,715
Like, Udio does me better than I do you sometimes.

439
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:47,215
Honestly, so it's a really cool experience if you have like a pre-existing music you can really play with it a lot.

440
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:53,143
And in a way that I think about Suno is your in-house music producer.

441
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,089
I like to describe it in a way that I feel like

442
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:03,334
Somewhere in the system prompt of Suno's model, they have like top 40 music in there.

443
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,615
Because it always comes out really polished and clean.

444
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:09,576
And maybe it's the way that the data that they put into the model in the first place.

445
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:14,378
But my experience with Suno has been that it just comes out really, really clean.

446
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,199
Top 40-ish.

447
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:20,681
One thing it's gotten really, really good at lately is like a side note.

448
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:33,395
is that when I first, I personally have onboarded like I think a dozen or so people over the last couple weeks because I wanted to understand what is the actual use case for these services.

449
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:37,818
So I just started onboarding friends and family, some of my music friends, people that are not into music at all.

450
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:50,286
And what I found a couple weeks ago was that like when I would generate songs, if you're not super specific in counting the syllables in each line of the song when you're getting into the custom mode of Zuno,

451
00:37:51,807 --> 00:38:00,632
The timing of the beat and the artist, quote unquote, the vocals, lyrics, gets super off, really, really, really off.

452
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,132
But they've gotten really good about this lately.

453
00:38:02,753 --> 00:38:06,215
The last couple songs I've generated from Suno aren't off.

454
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:10,137
The song structure's a lot better, because that's another tip we'll get into.

455
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:16,420
The song structure really has improved a lot in Suno over the last couple weeks.

456
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:21,640
But it's more or less the same, just the outputs are a little bit different from what we have.

457
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,423
And now we can listen to it.

458
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:29,365
So have you guys, anyone submitted any songs yet?

459
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:31,847
Let me see, let me check.

460
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:36,910
I was just generating some music for my boy Patrick.

461
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,891
We're going to play that in a second.

462
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,832
But that was the basic tutorial.

463
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:41,413
It's about as simple as it gets.

464
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:44,975
It really, really lowers the barrier to entry for creating music.

465
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:52,894
We can get into some other stuff about like more conversations about that, but I think for now I'll just say that it lowers the barrier.

466
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:58,677
It makes it easier to create stuff for, you know, specific situations.

467
00:38:58,777 --> 00:38:59,858
Okay, nice, we have a couple submissions.

468
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:00,778
We have a couple submissions.

469
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:11,944
But the gist of it is you go to video.com, you log in, you go to this, oh, they used to have, oh, I guess here at the top, it always says recreate.

470
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:16,407
Then you can type in, oh, what's another one?

471
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,502
The AI Engineer World's Fair.

472
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:27,124
I'm sorry, a song about the AI Engineer World's Fair.

473
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:40,750
And I know the organizer Benjamin Dunphy really likes old school hip hop.

474
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,671
So I'll generate a song.

475
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,812
So you come in, you type in your prompt, you hit create.

476
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,071
There's a couple of different options out here.

477
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:53,773
Again, if you have a free account, you won't need to see this experimental longer song.

478
00:39:53,873 --> 00:39:59,796
You'll be defaulted to the UDIO32 model, but you can come in and write your own lyrics on top of this prompt that you just put in.

479
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:06,719
Or you can select to only have an instrumental generated as opposed to a full song with lyrics and everything.

480
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:11,787
So at its core, that's how it works for pretty much all these services as well.

481
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:15,211
There's not so much beyond that that you need to know to start generating music.

482
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:23,020
I would argue that there's a lot more that you need to know if you want to get good at it, but that's pretty much how we generate music on both services.

483
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:29,892
And what I like to do, just to get a nice even comparison and choose the same exact prompt, I'll refresh the page.

484
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:39,535
Because for some reason, they're really buggy sometimes, where if you generate song after song without refreshing the page, you get extensions of songs as opposed to a brand new song.

485
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:45,256
But I will go ahead and create based on this prompt.

486
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:51,445
And then I'm going to come back, because we've now gone through the basic tutorial.

487
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:54,307
I'm going to come back and look at some questions, because I know some questions came in.

488
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:55,108
Nice.

489
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:03,415
And in the meantime, while I'm getting my thoughts together, I'm going to play my song, the song that was created for Patrick.

490
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:05,517
Wishing him a happy birthday.

491
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:06,617
Oh, moderation error.

492
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,761
They didn't like your, my Randy Travis.

493
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:14,804
Let's go ahead and play this one.

494
00:41:22,222 --> 00:41:31,717
It's your day, Patrick, we're singing loud for you Oh yes, oh yes, it's true It's your time, Patrick, celebrate the whole day through

495
00:42:01,428 --> 00:42:04,470
We know, Patrick, you love that rock and roll.

496
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,432
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.

497
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:10,232
And country hits you feel in your soul.

498
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:12,313
Oh, yeah, oh, yes.

499
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:15,555
Patrick, what you think?

500
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,536
It's great.

501
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:17,776
Thank you.

502
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:21,738
It's a theme song for my sitcom now.

503
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:24,660
Patrick said it's the theme song for his sitcom.

504
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,180
I'm going to play these other two quick.

505
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,141
I just want to hear what they sound like.

506
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,353
Real quick, if you click on the actual song name, you can see the lyrics on the Suno side.

507
00:42:41,155 --> 00:43:01,191
Birthday candles flame so bright For a connoisseur of music's life Rocking through the day and night Patrick's world is pure delight

508
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:09,902
I'm going to try the other version and see if, was that more your speed, Patrick?

509
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,163
No, they were both great.

510
00:43:11,803 --> 00:43:12,563
Oh, awesome.

511
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,883
OK, all right.

512
00:43:15,003 --> 00:43:26,085
We've got five minutes left.

513
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:34,387
OK, so either they generated the same song twice or, yeah, maybe.

514
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:36,487
Yeah.

515
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:38,614
Let's see what the AI engineer world's here is on.

516
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:41,655
And actually, let's address these questions, because we only have a couple minutes left.

517
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:48,696
And then I'll get into the notes real quick, because I did want to show you guys some of the prompt stuff.

518
00:43:48,856 --> 00:43:53,617
The truth is that I have everything under the notes section, pretty much everything I talked about today.

519
00:43:54,077 --> 00:44:04,339
Also, when the recording becomes available, you can come back to the same page, get access to the recording, and then I'll hopefully have the transcript up in an hour, because I recorded it myself.

520
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:16,304
But if you come here to this page, aietalk.com slash music, and click on the notes section, and you want to now listen to me talk about the prompts, you can find the prompt stuff yourself.

521
00:44:17,265 --> 00:44:20,767
Not quite all the way at the bottom, but here close to the bottom.

522
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:26,887
And this is a GPT prompt, meaning you literally can go to chat GPT, use this prompt.

523
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:35,650
It got a little bit weird, like for some reason when I use these closing brackets in GitHub, it like basically disappears the whole, you won't even see lyrics anymore.

524
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,151
But basically what you can do is, I think even this would work, like GPT-4 is now smart enough to do this.

525
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:48,274
You can take and you can put in this template, and then actually fill in the top here where it says song description, and GPT will actually produce some coherent lyrics.

526
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,615
And it allows for better music generation when you

527
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:58,960
come in with the lyrics as opposed to giving it a general topic and hoping it comes up with the lyrics itself, you can kind of tweak the lyrics yourself before you start to generate it.

528
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,281
So that's the GPT prompt.

529
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:08,706
And then for the music model prompts, these are pretty much just examples of what we just did with Patrick and the AI Engineer World's Fair song.

530
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:15,070
It's just like a general description of a song that you want to hear, that you want to generate, and then it pops out the other end.

531
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:20,908
Super pressed for time.

532
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:30,211
There are some official Oudio and Zuno tips that are very useful as well.

533
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:33,271
And then here, I kind of want to get into the prompt matching thing, actually.

534
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:46,074
Philip asked, is there a way to do voice transfer of a more generic voice rather than a specific voice, referring to the voice conversion stuff that we talked about earlier?

535
00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:48,875
And I think the end of that question got cut off.

536
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,228
As you said, like.

537
00:45:51,248 --> 00:46:04,392
Are you talking about doing voice conversion training, like training models yourself, like going to one of the services or downloading the tools?

538
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,333
You literally can just take and blend multiple voices.

539
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:18,317
So the way that it works is like you need, depending on what service or model you're using or what training tools that you're using, you need like minimum six seconds of someone's voice to start training.

540
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:21,499
and you get like a kind of coherent model after that.

541
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:28,363
But what you can essentially do is just six seconds of your voice, six seconds of his voice, six seconds of Eminem, and it kind of blends it together.

542
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:36,368
Or you can just go to a TTS service and get like an actual robot voice, like a voice that doesn't belong to a real person, and then use that to train on.

543
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:38,830
So yeah, for copyright purposes, yeah, you can do that.

544
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:48,076
Okay, what recommendations do you have to help advocate for the responsible and ethical use

545
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:52,360
Yeah, sorry about that.

546
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,384
I don't know why the questions are getting cut off.

547
00:46:57,884 --> 00:47:00,006
Ethical use of AI music.

548
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,990
That's a good one.

549
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:06,151
I'm going to be honest.

550
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:08,153
I'm going to plead the fifth because I'm not a lawyer.

551
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:10,475
I'm going to be completely honest.

552
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:12,296
I'm going to be completely honest.

553
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,938
Ethics have nothing to do with law.

554
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:16,580
Oh, yeah, yeah.

555
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:17,815
Good point.

556
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:22,839
What tool generates the best clone voice that can match emotional tone like Kendrick Lamar's Euphoria?

557
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,860
Three switches.

558
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:25,922
What's the best clone voice?

559
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:27,443
I would definitely look into RVC.

560
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:29,024
If you can, you can use RVC in the cloud.

561
00:47:29,044 --> 00:47:33,528
You don't have to, like, when you Google RVC, there comes up a bunch of tutorials on how to run it yourself locally.

562
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:34,489
You do not have to do that.

563
00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:39,953
You can run it in the cloud because you need some decent hardware to do, like, computer hardware to do it.

564
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:41,194
But definitely look into RVC.

565
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,975
It's the best right now.

566
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,477
Can we have access to the slides?

567
00:47:44,537 --> 00:47:44,737
Yeah.

568
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,030
And my time is up shortly.

569
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,491
Oh, oh, did my thing go to sleep?

570
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:58,118
It did go to sleep.

571
00:47:58,218 --> 00:47:59,539
Oh, it said log into, who do you want to know?

572
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:03,002
Really?

573
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:08,987
Oh, okay, okay, sorry.

574
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:10,729
That's my blunder.

575
00:48:13,912 --> 00:48:14,532
That was pretty much it.

576
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:17,533
Rate Your Music is something you should definitely check out.

577
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:32,018
What someone basically reverse engineered is that these models were trained on labels from Rate Your Music, so you can almost reverse engineer exactly what sound you want by going to Rate Your Music, typing in an artist name, typing in a genre, or

578
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:41,458
We're really just typing in what you want to hear and then using whatever labels they put on that music you put it back into the model itself sooner or later.

579
00:48:41,698 --> 00:48:47,423
Stable audio sometimes I think and you can get like very very close to a specific sound.

580
00:48:47,443 --> 00:48:50,186
I don't want to say specific artists but yeah you can get pretty close.

581
00:48:52,928 --> 00:48:56,831
Yes and I was going to get into like the law thing.

582
00:48:57,762 --> 00:48:59,943
You want me to differentiate between ethics and law, and I understand.

583
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:02,424
But I was going to get into it a little bit, but we kind of ran out of time.

584
00:49:02,464 --> 00:49:03,905
So I apologize for that.

585
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:06,166
If you guys would like, I love to talk about this stuff all day.

586
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:10,648
If you want to approach me after the workshop, and we chop it up all day about this stuff, I love it.

587
00:49:10,668 --> 00:49:11,629
Yeah.

588
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:21,113
And then what I'll do for giving away the accounts, maybe I'll do like a live stream or something like that, and do like a grab everybody's email we submitted.

589
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:23,875
Because I think we had 12 submissions.

590
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:24,595
Let me refresh.

591
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,661
I think we had 12 submissions.

592
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:28,882
And I'll pick somebody and just send you guys.

593
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:31,924
I'll change the username and password so everybody can't log into your stuff.

594
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:34,105
And then I'll give you the accounts.

595
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,267
But yeah, I appreciate you guys for coming.

596
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:39,949
I hope you guys got something out of this and walked away with some music, generators, and stuff.

597
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:43,031
And I think I'll play a song to go out.

598
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:52,937
Walking through the fair, copper wires in the air, coders in the screen.

599
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:16,264
I wonder what we have generated.

600
00:50:19,745 --> 00:50:24,928
Oh, oh, first, because I just saw the question that someone said, stems, how to like pull the stems out and like edit them.

601
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:41,116
There's a tool, again, not a, like I have no affiliation with them, but you just go to, actually the easy way to do this is let's say we just take this happy birthday song by Patrick, we go to suno.com, all you have to do is suno.com,

602
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:54,605
sunodaw.com, like literally go to the link where you just generated the song, type in DAW, Digital Audio Workstation, at the end of the URL, not the end of the URL, but the end of the domain name, and hit enter.

603
00:50:55,686 --> 00:51:02,031
And I think it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to, let's go ahead and sign in real quick.

604
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:08,006
to 90 seconds, I've had to wait longer for some of the songs because it's more complicated to do.

605
00:51:08,947 --> 00:51:25,338
Sorry, guys, I forgot to mention this, but yeah, like if you go and do that, type in DAW at the end of the suno song, it'll pull that exact song that you just generated into this digital audio workstation and give you stem by stem and then let you control the volume of each specific stem.

606
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:27,739
And by stem I just mean each specific instrument.

607
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:30,341
They do all the different instruments and then the vocal itself.

608
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:33,723
So this is a really, really cool tool that I think is like a startup

609
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:44,503
But it's a really, really cool tool for like being able to get more control out of your generations.

610
00:51:46,124 --> 00:51:49,386
So I just wanted to.

611
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,087
So digital audio workstation.

612
00:51:52,368 --> 00:51:53,068
And you can like.

613
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:59,992
And let's say I don't like the vocals, but I really like the music.

614
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:15,545
And this is just vocal.

615
00:52:15,826 --> 00:52:17,007
It's the bass.

616
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:43,226
Rock tunes flowing in his veins.

617
00:52:44,527 --> 00:52:51,709
Patrick exits through the rain.

618
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:57,631
Happy birthday, Patrick dear.

619
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:02,233
Let the music keep you near.

620
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,401
So yeah, that's pretty much how you use Wave.

621
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,522
It's called a Wave tool, that service.

622
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:14,484
So that's how you can get the stems.

623
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:18,147
There's also another tool called UVR5, but it gets really involved.

624
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:29,295
You do have to have like decent hardware, but you can also use like, instead of using like an online service where, I think all the accounts on Wave tool right now are free, but you can use UVR5 locally forever.

625
00:53:29,576 --> 00:53:33,939
It's like an open source software project that allows you to pull stems just like this, literally.

626
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,063
And that's not just AI-generated music.

627
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:39,805
Any song you can put into UVR5

628
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,947
and get, like, the stings from it is actually pretty cool.

629
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:42,788
I know.

630
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:42,948
Yeah.

631
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:47,032
Appreciate it.

632
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:49,975
I know they want you guys to go over to the, what was it called again?

633
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:52,057
Yeah, the general session.

634
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:54,419
So I'm going to shut up now.

635
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:55,901
Yeah, I appreciate you guys.

636
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:56,241
Thank you.

637
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:57,002
Thank you for coming.
